## The Process

The creation started when our professor from the UX Design class tasked us to do the low fidelity wireframe. The reason for this minimal design is that I have contents that will likely compete my website design that is why I opted not to give too much elements.

Attached below is the image for my low fidelity prototype

Come to a time that we're done with the high fidelity layout, we had the chance to show it to our classmates and get their feedback what to remove or retain. I honestly had a feeling that the cards below the banner is overwhelming or too much elements, someone had suggested that I remove the buttons as clicking the image can already leads the users to the projects' link. So I decided to remove it, and improve the header as the nav links were smaller on the low-fidelity prototype.

Here's the final look before I do coding.
