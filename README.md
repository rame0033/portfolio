## Prototyping

The creation started when our professor from the UX Design class tasked us to do the low fidelity wireframe. The reason for this minimal design is that I have contents that will likely compete my website design that is why I opted not to give too much elements.

Attached below is the image for my low fidelity prototype

Come to a time that we're done with the high fidelity layout, we had the chance to show it to our classmates and get their feedback what to remove or retain. I honestly had a feeling that the cards below the banner is overwhelming or too much elements, someone had suggested that I remove the buttons as clicking the image can already lead the users to the projects' link. So I decided to remove it, and improve the header as the nav links were smaller on the low-fidelity prototype.

Here's the final look before I do coding.

## And now the coding part...

As I have said earlier, the design is not too much complicated but I have too much pages because most of it were dedicated for categories, and also write-up explanations for individual projects specifically for graphic design and web development. I have to code first the page for each project since it has the simplest design but other than that, it has to be repeated at least nine times. 

### File linking
This is my first problematic encounter when I am on my early stage of coding my projects page. I have already finished the layout and pushed the code to my GitHub repository. Local render was fine but when I tried to enter the github pages link, my layout and images didn't render although I believed that time that all assets were linked properly to my HTML files. 

I tried to read some internet discussions regarding github pages,consulted our mentor and find out that I missed a detail. When it comes to linking and my file is in a subdirectory, it is required to do e.g. `../css/styles.css` since it is a relative path hence the browser will be able to find it and apply my styles and image assets to the page. This applied also when I linked my cards and navigations and it made me confuse somehow because I have to locate all of page and assets from their respective folders to properly link them and able to render to GitHub pages.

### Codewell Mockup Pages
The **Spense landing page** and **Web Developer Portfolio** mockup page are courtesy of the Codewell module. Codewell is my website to go when I was doing some practice. Just like the [FrontEndMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/),they supply mock up pages and website that enable beginners like me to practice HTML and CSS. Unfortunately, Codewell's website was taken down that is why I cannot link my project to the original mock-up module.
